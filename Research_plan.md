# Research project DOuwe Schulte march - july 2019

## General plan

I want to build software to be able to find the amino acid sequence of a protein based on mass spectroscopy data. The paper will be describing the general algorithm used in the software and will be stating some details about the trustworthynes of the software based on wetlab praticals and will give the sequence of an "unknown" protein to really do a thorough test.

## Planning

3.5 days of preliminairy work on the software before the course started
1 half week of project planning and prework
3 half weeks of wetlab to generate the mass spec data used to test the software
2 half weeks to finish the software 
5 half weeks to write the article
